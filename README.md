# Horizons
Simple GPS and Artificial Horizon app; Kotlin; 

The application is addressed for those who dream about the flying experiene,
although cannot afford a plane. Horizons app gives a simple UI of maps layout,
original artificial horizon indicator based on the Russian old-school gear.

The Horizons broadens not only my skills as a begginer native Android developer, 
but also it broadens the user's horizons by inviting to explore the world with
our application installed. 


Lol, jk, I just want to pass my Digital Signal Processing project.
